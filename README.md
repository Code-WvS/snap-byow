Snap! Build Your Own World
Like Minecraft in Snap!, just better! Snap-BYOW adds a voxel engine. [Try it](http://code-wvs.github.io/snap-byow/snap.html)

Notes:
  * enter interactive mode in full screen stage mode, let your browser capture the mouse
  * exit interactive mode by pressing escape twice - once to uncapture the mouse, the second time to exit full stage mode
  * only `world` and `player` categories are modified
  * `material 0` is air, 1 is grass, 2 are bricks, 3 is earth
  * modify the player's view and position through the stage
  * newly created sprites ("mobs") always span at the same point
  * skin customization is not possible
  * cloud saving does not work

This project was a weekend project and is not under active development.
